# This course of DevOps

I came to learn to this course with an open and very empty mind. In the meaning that I have zero experience in this subject. I had no idea what the content of this course will be and what I will learn (what I will be taught). I chose to apply for this course to widen my knowledge of ICT without actually knowing what knowledge this "DevOps" contains. I just had heard of it and I knew I should learn of it. I know that there is also job opportunities in the field of DevOps. Otherwise I had no expectations for the course, because of the lack of knowledge to the subject and zero experience on how these kind of courses are completed. I had an idea that github will be used at some point and I was excited about that fact, because github is something that I have some knowledge of before hand. 

I expected to learn something around using github and something from version control. Otherwise my mind was not set on any particular knowledge piece that I would have been particularly waiting. In the coming parts of this diary it will be explained more thoroughly what I actually learned, but I can tell already that my expectations were exceeded many times over with even more interesting pieces of knowledge that I could have ever imagined. The contents of this course and the type of knowledge the course contained suprised me many times and I noticed that I really had no idea what DevOps even means. All the suprises were happy and I was in constant awe about the contents of the course and the consept of DevOps. The studying methods also suprised me many times over and I was particularly pleased of the fact how we could utilize github in our learning process and in this final project. 

# Learned more than expected

It propably is needless to say that I learned quite maximal amount of information during this course, because it was 99% of new knowledge for me. I had no idea what DevOps meant and I was excited to know of it's connection as an idea with origin in Japanese way of thinking (Kaizen, Kata). In my original profession lean, six sigma, 5s and others are in important role and I was pumped from excitement when I understood the fact that DevOps is similar process in the field of ICT than the other tools were in my original profession. I also liked the fun fact about Andon Cord, even though it is not straight DevOps-related nor actually sounding very efficient to stop the whole line when somebody gets an idea (or maybe it does not happen very often anymore?). The difference of automated processes in the field of IT seem to work very differently from automated processes in my original field in industry. When something in ICT is automated, there really is no need for a person to maintain and maintenance the process for it to work. In the industry there usually always has to be a person present all times to monitor the proper working of the automated system, a person called an operator. I also realised how much faster, easier and with less effort ICT processes can be automated compared to even some simple tasks in industry, and how much easier it is to fix and change the automated process in ICT. 

The most challenging part of this course must have been doing the A+ tasks, because the multiple choise questions were all or nothing questions and with no earlier knowledge of the contents of the course it made the answering process (succeeding in it with points) quite hard. The questions also had a lot of tricky options in the wording that really lead me into the wrong direction with the answers, because the subjects are new to me and I am still a novice in it meanwhile English is not my first language and some words that were used in the wording of the options were quite rare. I am content on the result of the points that I achieved, and I am really happy to have reached such a level that I could. 

The least challenging part would be this project, but I feel that I would not have been ready for the more advanced project at this point while I am still a novice with the subject. This has still been a challenge, even though it was the least challenging part. Nothing has been easy, I can promise that. I really enjoyed this project though, and I am happy that this was part of the course tasks. 

Thank you for the interesting course!
